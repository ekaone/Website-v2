At first you have an Object.

```js
const color = {
  red: "#FF0000",
};
```

You may use `in` and conditional function.

```js
"red" in color;

// with conditional
if ("red" in color) {
  // do something
}
```

Or another way, use `hasOwnProperty()`.

```js
// with hasOwnProperty
color.hasOwnProperty("red");
```
