Modern blogs usually use `slug` as the identity of data, here is an example of reading `slug` from an object.

```js
const posts = {
  "mountain-view": {
    name: "Everest",
    height: 8848,
  },
  "building-world": {
    name: "Burj Khalifa",
    height: 828,
  },
};

const slugs = Object.entries(posts).map(([slug, { name, height }]) => {
  return slug;
});

console.log(slugs); // [ 'mountain-view', 'building-world' ]
```
